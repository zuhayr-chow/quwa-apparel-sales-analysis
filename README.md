# 🧵 Quwa Apparel Sales Analysis Dashboard

This project analyzes sales data from **Quwa Apparel** — my own streetwear clothing brand — using **Python** and **Power BI**. The goal is to uncover key business insights, identify top-performing products, and make better decisions for inventory, marketing, and customer engagement.

## 📦 About Quwa Apparel
Quwa Apparel is a modest streetwear brand I founded, inspired by purpose, community, and clean design.

## 🎯 Project Objective

As the founder of Quwa Apparel, I wanted to use real sales data to better understand how our products perform, when customers buy most, and what drives revenue growth. This project combines technical data skills with business decision-making to:

- Track revenue trends and product performance
- Identify top-selling and high-margin items
- Compare new vs repeat customer behavior
- Support better decisions for marketing, restocks, and seasonal drops

By building this dashboard, I aimed to bridge the gap between analytics and real-world action for a growing streetwear brand.
